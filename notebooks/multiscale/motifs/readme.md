## Motif Analysis for Pinky PyC Subgraph
Investigate local graph-theoretic properties of 334 pyrimdals cells as a simple directed graph with no self-loops and multi-edges.

-  2-cell and 3-cell motifs statistics compared with the directed Erdös-Rényi model (ER) and the configuration model (CFG) (Figure 5 B, C, E, F; Table 1 C_obs, C_ER, C_CFG; Table S1; Table S2)

- Common neighbor rule compared with ER and CFG (Figure 5 G)

- 3-cell motifs statistics compared with the generalized ER and CFG models which preserve the stats of 2-cell motifs. (Figure 5S C, D, E; Table 1 C_gER, C_gCFG; Table S3)
