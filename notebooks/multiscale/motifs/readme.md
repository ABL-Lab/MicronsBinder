## Motif Analysis for Pinky PyC Subgraph
Investigate local graph-theoretic properties of 363 pyrimdals cells as a simple directed graph with no self-loops and multi-edges. The prefix `th{x}-` indicates neurons with axon lengths less than x μm are excluded in the network analysis.

-  Cell localtions, axon lengths, in and out degree distributions.

-  2-cell and 3-cell motifs statistics compared with the directed Erdös-Rényi model (ER) and the configuration model (CFG), and their generalizations which preserve the statistics of 2-cell motifs.
